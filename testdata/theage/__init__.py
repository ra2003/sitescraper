    ('1.html', ["""PREMIER John Brumby has commissioned taxpayer-funded polling to gauge public reaction to the prospect of the Government building the contentious "missing link" in Melbourne's ring road.

Mr Brumby's department has engaged market research firm I-view to assess voters' views on a range of controversial projects he is considering for inclusion in a multibillion-dollar plan to tackle Melbourne's road and public transport congestion.

The telephone survey asks people their opinion on suggestions that the Metropolitan Ring Road be extended from Greensborough to the EastLink tollway at Ringwood, through some of the city's most environmentally sensitive areas.

The Opposition last night said the Government had been caught out secretly polling residents on a plan local Labor MPs claimed they opposed.

The Opposition's planning spokesman and member for the Northern Metropolitan Region, Matthew Guy, said building the ring road's missing link would require construction through one of Melbourne's "green wedges" and compulsory acquisition of homes in Diamond Creek, Warrandyte North and on the south side of the Yarra River.

"For years the Labor members for Yan Yean (Danielle Green) and Eltham (Steve Herbert) have claimed they are against building a ring road, but now we find their own party is in fact conducting research to ascertain whether the road has public support," Mr Guy said.

Government spokesman Ben Ruse last night said extending the ring road had not been ruled in or out. He said the Government was consulting widely on options for its transport statement, expected to be released in October or November.

Mr Brumby said last month that several groups had been lobbying the Government to include the "missing link" in the transport blueprint.

"But it's a very difficult issue because if you're to build that link it goes through some very sensitive areas of parkland," he said. "And you'd need to look at things like tunnels and so on to preserve the environment."

 he RACV, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Victorian Freight and Logistics Council are among influential lobby groups that hope Mr Brumby announces a plan to complete the ring road as part of his pre-Christmas transport statement.

The I-view survey is also asking people their views on the two main proposals in Sir Rod Eddington's report to the Government: an 18-kilometre road tunnel linking the Eastern Freeway with CityLink and the Ring Road; and a 17-kilometre rail tunnel from Footscray to Caulfield via the CBD and St Kilda Road."""]),
    ('2.html', ["""PETER Costello is by far the desired Liberal leader, preferred by 56% of voters against Brendan Nelson, in an Age/Nielsen poll that also sees a big plunge in Dr Nelson's approval, putting further pressure on the Opposition.

    - Costello leads poll
    - Nelson's rising disapproval
    - PM's approval falling

    Mr Costello has more than double Dr Nelson's 27% support in a head-to-head contest. In a three-way contest, Mr Costello - who has yet to declare his future - scores 44% to Malcolm Turnbull's 27% and Dr Nelson's 17%.

    The poll has mixed news for Mr Turnbull. In a straight contest with Mr Costello, he is badly behind (35%-49%). But in a head-to-head with Dr Nelson, he has an overwhelming lead (47%-31%).

    This would put Mr Turnbull in a good position if Mr Costello carried through his earlier indications that he will depart politics - but badly placed if the former treasurer changes his mind and stays.

    The latest support for Mr Costello comes as Dr Nelson's approval fell five points to 31%. His disapproval has risen seven point to 53% in the national poll of 1400 people taken between Thursday and Saturday.

    This is the first time a majority of voters has disapproved of him as Opposition Leader. Since the last poll, Dr Nelson had a major setback when he was forced to retreat, amid bad publicity, from his push to toughen the Opposition's climate change policy.

    Kevin Rudd leads Dr Nelson as preferred prime minister, 65% (steady) to 19% (down one). But Mr Rudd's approval has fallen six points to 60% - his lowest rating as Prime Minister although still very high. His disapproval has risen four points to 31%.

    The past month has seen no significant change in voting intentions, with Labor's two-party vote up just one point to 55% and the Coalition down one to 45%. Labor's primary vote is steady on 43%; the Coalition is down one point to 39%. The Government's two-party support is still above what it polled at the November election. Continued...

    ('3.html', ["""A MELBOURNE engineer is working on a computer program that can diagnose depressed teenagers simply by analysing their voice.

    The world-first research, by RMIT senior lecturer Margaret Lech, could transform psychiatry, which lacks an objective test for this illness. It could even be used as a screening test in high schools or when someone phones a health provider.

    "We want to develop an objective system that could be applied by people with no clinical knowledge about depression," Dr Lech said.

    "The latest research shows that depression starts at an early age, so if it's detected it will help a teenager understand their behaviour and learn how to deal with it."

    Dr Lech said her research was inspired by a Stephen Fry documentary about his manic depression and a TV interview with former premier and beyondblue chairman Jeff Kennett. She asked herself how she could help with the growing problem of youth depression, and realised her work in speech analysis at RMIT's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering might provide insights.

    She contacted Associate Professor Nicholas Allen from the ORYGEN Research Centre and the department of psychology at the University of Melbourne. Professor Allen had compiled video and audio recordings of more than 300 adolescents at various stages of depression.

    Dr Lech's computer program is scanning through the voice data, using pattern recognition techniques to seek telltale "harmonics" unique to a depressed person's voice. It can detect harmonics related to seven different emotions, including fear, excitement or anxiety.

    The theory is that those emotions are expressed in a different way in the voice of a depressed teenager. The program is able to tell the difference between the voices of a group of people suffering from depression from a non-depressed group  though it is not yet developed enough to diagnose an individual with sufficient certainty.

    Professor Allen said the research was at an early stage but showed great promise. "In clinical work, the voice is often one of the first things you notice (in depressed patients)," he said.

    "I can tell with my patients on the phone, sometimes after only a few words, how they are going. You can hear a flatness, a tension coming through. The voice changes very dramatically when they are depressed.

    "It is a logical target for a diagnostic tool. We are a long way away from having something that's clinically useful, though."

    He speculated that it could be used in mass screening, to flag "at risk" people for a more exhaustive assessment.

    The researchers are announcing the study to coincide with National Science Week, which runs until next Sunday.

    As court artist Glenda Brigham remembers it, the prosecution of two men over the murders of policemen Gary Silk and Rodney Miller in 1998 needed no other introduction.
    
    She felt shock when she learned of the Moorabbin shootings, because she had taught art at a school in the same district.
    
    Four years after the police officers were killed on duty, she was sitting in the Supreme Court, sketching images for the television station's court reports.
    
    Sensing the tension in the courtroom and the importance of the case, Brigham kept returning to the case to draw.
    
    She captured the accused men, Bandali Debs and Jason Roberts, as they peered over the high walls of the dock that were then in court 12 of the historic court building.
    
    Barristers were captured in full flight, the families of the accused and victims were shown grim-faced, scientists and police witnesses were depicted as they gave the technical evidence that helped secure two murder convictions.
    
    One sketch shows Jason Roberts sitting in the foreground while a larger image of him — from his videotaped police interview — is presented on the courtroom wall.  
    Brigham has a portfolio of almost 50 drawings from the trial in the last quarter of 2002, and a subsequent appeal hearing almost two years later.
    
    As police commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Silk/Miller killings, Brigham is looking for a venue and a sponsor to help her present an exhibition of her record of the court proceedings.
    
    She says she knows of no other Victorian court artist who has tried to sketch an entire trial. Brigham believes she could prepare the sketches for exhibit within three months — if she had the money for materials as she prepares oil paintings from some of the drawings.
    
    "I like to think I'm taking my work to another level. I'm not just (drawing) a … head or a likeness of someone. I want to tell a story. I suppose I'm a natural storyteller," she said.

    ('5.html', ["""THE theft of car satellite navigation systems has emerged as Victoria's biggest crime trend in the past financial year.
    
    Crime figures for the 2007-08 financial year show that in the category of theft from motor vehicles, 6787 global position systems were stolen.
    
    In 2006-07, 1632 were stolen.
    
    The figures mean that an average of 19 GPS systems were stolen in the state every day, accounting for about 13% of all thefts from motor vehicles reported to police.
    
    About 47,000 cars were broken into during the year, at a cost of more than $31 million to the community.
    
    A Victoria Police spokesman described theft from vehicles as "purely an opportunistic offence".
    
    "If people didn't leave valuables in their cars it would reduce the opportunities for thieves to steal," he said.
    
    "We've been through it with mobile phones and we've been through it with laptop computers, and to some degree the public has started to heed the warnings about that.
    
    "But something has been lost in the translation because they still leave their satellite navigation systems on full display on the windscreen or dashboard."
    
    He said many motorists who did not leave GPS systems on display stored them in the car's glove box, which was the first place thieves looked if they saw the cradles the devices sat in, or the marks the cradle suction cups left on windscreens.
    
    In most of these cases it would take "less than 30 seconds to break in, steal the device and leave", he said.
    
    Almost half the cars that had been broken into had their windows smashed.
    
    In other crime trends, the spokesman said homicides and crimes against people had dropped but robberies had increased.
    
    The state's crime statistics will be released today."""]),
