Hola, amigos. I know it's been a long time since I rapped at ya, but things have been getting plenty hairy around here. First, I been running like a chicken with its head cut off trying to find some new tires for my Festiva. I know, a tire is a tire, but these are some weird-ass size that no one makes anymore. I caught a flat on one and I've been driving on my spare for about a month now. It don't worry me none, but if I get another flat, I'm screwed.

On top of that, I had my hours cut at the electronics store. My manager told me it was because of the economic downturn that people weren't buying anything. I told him that without a full-time check, I wasn't going to be buying anything either, so how did this help? That stumped him but good.

In order to live the lifestyle I'm accustomed to, I had to find me another part-time job. I went around to the pizza joints, because they always need delivery guys, but they were all hung up on having proof of insurance. I told them I had insurance, but I was just a couple months late on payments, but they weren't hearing it. Man, when did everyone start getting so tight-assed?

The thing that's really been chafing me is how hot it is. They say it ain't the heat, it's the humidity, but I really don't give a shit which it is. Either way, after being outside a while, my undies are stuck to my ass, and I got pit stains that meet at my chest. Last year, I pulled an air conditioner off my neighbor's curb and put that in my window. It did the trick. Wound up costing me a boatload when I got my electrical bill, but it was worth it. This year, it wouldn't turn on, so I dragged it back over to my neighbor's.

During the day, it wasn't so bad, because I was at work and they keep the electronics store a chilly 72 degrees. At quittin' time, I would go to the discount movie theater. But after seeing the cartoon where the chimps go to space for the fourth time, I couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't just the movie, but all the families with kids in there were looking at me like I had a turd growing on my head.

Really, I don't mind it being hot when I'm just sitting in my apartment chilling out and watching some TV, but it's a real bitch to get to sleep. I've tried everything. I put some cardboard down so I could sleep on my floor, but it smelled like moldy pizza crust and socks. I got an old box fan from Ron and plugged that in, but it rattled all night and barely cooled me down. Then I tried sleeping with a six-pack of ice-cold Miller Genuine Draft in my bed, but I wound up drinking it all. I guess that sort of worked anyway.

Finally, after my fourth night of not sleeping, I came up with a plan. I figured that since they had to keep the store cool even at night, I should just sleep in there. Why not? I could just kick back in a video game chair and finally get some decent shut-eye.

The only thing was, I had to find some way to stay in the store until after they locked up. I was only supposed to work until 6:00, and since I usually leave around 5:30, it would look weird for me to be hanging around for an extra four and a half hours until they closed. I asked all around to see if I could pick up someone else's shift, you know, kill two birds with one stone and make a little extra money. I almost had this guy Wayne on the hook, but he was taking off the next weekend and he needed all the hours he could get. What a dick.

Since I wasn't going to be able to hide in plain sight, I figured that I should do the next best thing and hide out of sight. Now, if I knew I was gonna have to lay low until everyone left, I would've cased out a place to park comfortably for a couple of hours. Since I didn't, I had to do like my man Vin Diesel and improvise.

I went about my business like I was leaving, and clocked out and headed to the door. At the last minute, I pretended like I was interested in looking at the computer display. In order to throw people off my trail, I told one of my coworkers that it looked like some kid was going to steal video games. He went off to tell security, and once the coast was clear, I ducked back by the TVs. Sure enough, there was plenty of room on the shelves behind the display models. I climbed up there and got myself situated.

It didn't look comfortable, but I was wiped. As soon as I was sure I was out of sight, I dozed off.

When I came to, everything was dark. Perfect. It worked just like I had planned. I just had to go down, find the video game chair, and finish the night. That's when I realized that my leg was asleep. Not just asleep, but pretty much dead. It must have been from lying on that tangle of cords. I tried to wiggle my toes, but it didn't seem to be working. All of a sudden, my leg spasmed, and I kicked one of the TVs off the shelf.

My first thought was that I could just pick it up in the morning, before anyone got there, and I could catch some more Z's in the meantime. That's when the alarm went off. I looked all around for another hiding spot, but there wasn't one I could get to with my leg all dead. Plus, I wasn't going to be able to sleep with that alarm going off. I hightailed it to the emergency exit, which set off another alarm. I wasn't about to try and make it to my car, because I could hear the cops coming, so I had to limp away as fast as I could to the parking lot of the mall across the way, where I could wait it out until the coast was clear.

I mostly got away with it, but the next Monday, my coworker Wayne told me that he knew that I was the guy who set off the alarm, since my car was still in the parking lot when he left that night. So now, to keep him quiet, I got to pick up a shift for him some time, only I got to punch in on his card so he still gets the money.

One of these days, I'm gonna put the hurt on that guy, but it's going to be served cold. If any of you got a lead on a job, that would be awesome. I can't live on mac and cheese much longer. Well, I could, but I'm getting real sick of it."""]),

Item! Have you ever noticed that you never see Miley Cyrus and Hanna Montana in the same room at the same time? (She's kind of like Superman and Peter Parker in that way.) Well, that's because the hot Disney singer and the hot teen singer are one and the same person! I hope I haven't put her father, country superstar Billy Ray Cyrus, in danger by revealing her secret identity, but it's news, and my job is to break big news.

Is it just me, or are there too many computer cartoons? Maybe my age is showing, but I'll take a good old-fashioned animated classic like Nimm's Secret over a dozen computer cartoons any day.

Item! One of the things that makes this country great is the way we choose our representatives, and we recently chose one of our most important representatives of all: Miss USA. It was nice to know that, in the midst of high gas prices and war and the subprime mortgage mess, we could come together as a nation and pick a young woman to stand for beauty and talent and womanhood for all America. And the winner this year, in a magical ceremony, was Miss Texas! As much as I like Donnie and Marie as hosts, I think that they made a mistake getting rid of Bert Parks. Now, there was a host! There was a voice! If they don't bring him back I'm not going to stop watching, but if someone could put a word in, that would be great.

Spring is in the air, so if you have bulbs that need planting, now is the time. What are you waiting for? Roll up those sleeves and get digging!

Item! Are they or aren't they? That question could apply to just about anyone or anything but, music fans, you know what I'm talking about! Rumor has it Bootylicious chanteuse Beyond and rap mogul Jay Zee tied the knot recently. Or did they? There's all sorts of conflicting stories behind these so-called nuptials, so I'll just put this out there: Jay, Beyond, you make a great couple, and you've been together for a while. So even if you didn't get married, you are married in my mind and in the minds of your fans. Why not just trot on down to city hall and get the paper?

Why do I know the name Kim Kardashian? I woke up in the middle of the night and it took me a few minutes before I realized that she was in a sex tape and is now on a reality show. But really, so what? She is just taking up the space in my brain that good, honest celebrities like Gabreille Carteris should hold. If it's that easy to get a reality show, I need to get an agent. But first, I need to get a good night's sleep.

Item! An anonymous New York businessman recently paid $1.5 million for a sex film of Marilyn Monroe. He says it will be kept private. All I can say is wow. No trashy sex tapes for Marilyn—no, she went for film. And it will be kept private. That's real class. You hear that, Miss Kardashian?

Item! I was walking down the street last week, when I started to get a powerful thirst for some peppermint tea (I cut out the coffee after noon as part of my new health regimen). I stopped by my favorite coffee shop and who should I spot but Ron Howard's brother! I have no idea what he was doing in my neck of the woods, but I decided I should just leave him alone. That didn't mean I couldn't watch him, though! Howard's brother seemed really down to earth. He ordered a latte, but he added his own sugar. Then he sat down and started reading The Cries Of 49 or something like that. I'll have to get that book and read it so I have an in next time I see him.

I just bought Bob & Doug McKenzie's album on CD the other day. And you know what? It still holds up. Take off, eh?

Item! It looks like the great lost cause of pop stardom Britney Spears is back on track. The head-shaving diva was recently in a car accident, but according to police on the scene, she passed the field sobriety test. You hear that, haters? There was no liquor involved. You go girl! We knew you could do it! You're only one step away from getting your kids back now. Let me know if you need a character witness.

A lot of people have wondered why I haven't weighed in on the Heath Leger tragedy yet. Well, you're just going to have to wonder a while longer.

Blind item! MTV gave a certain tubby gossip hack a series of one-hour specials about the goings-on of Hollywood. Hey, MTV, if you're so desperate to get commentary on the who, what, where, why, and when of celebrities that you'll hire any pathetic fatty who can bang on a keyboard and steal other people's pictures to post online, my number is in the book. And I don't work blue.

Well, that about wraps it up for this week's installment of "The Outside Scoop." I didn't get to everything I wanted to—like Jeff Bridge's parking problems or the identity of Hanna Montana—but that was only because of space. I meant to, honest! Hopefully, I'll put a little something in there about those jaw-droppers next time. But until then, the velvet rope is up, so I'll have to see you again…on the Outside! """]),
    ('3.html', ["Smoove Is Waiting", """
Girl, there comes a time when even a strong, well-dressed man must admit defeat.

It has been a long time since we broke up and you left me standing in the rain outside of your condo. As I walked home that evening, it never would have crossed my mind that four years from now you would not have returned to me, that you would have nearly gotten married, that you would not even receive one of my phone calls. Or my letters, text messages, faxes, or instant messages.

Four years ago this would have been inconceivable that you, my one true girl, could have stayed away from me for this long. Do you not remember how it once was? We were like two love prospectors who discovered richer and richer veins of pure ecstasy. We would bump and grind in the dimly lit tunnels as shining white donkeys would carry wagons of our love to be washed off and then smelted down into fine pieces of jewelry, which I would place on your naked chocolate body while you slept. When you awoke, we would freak again.

How could a love this sexy end? After many long nights in my round circular bed wondering, and long days looking at myself in my large oval mirror, I have come to the realization that we may never do the nasty again.

Damn.

I just wanted to use this opportunity to say that no matter what happens in my life or what happens I will be here, waiting for you. Even if I am married, living in the suburbs with three children, if you were to send me a note saying "Let's give it another chance" I would immediately abandon my life, rent out my old penthouse apartment, take my clothes out of storage, and immediately start creating a sumptuous dinner or breakfast for me to feed you, depending on the time of the day it was. That is what you mean to me.

I would, at this point, like to ask any women that I am currently dating to stop reading this column.

So, girl, if you doubt that I no longer love you, I ask you to remove that doubt, for this love is deep. Too deep to fade by the mere passage of time. If you worry about how you have treated me in the past, which, I think we both can admit, was cold, I would say that having you back in my arms was worth the pain and torment I have endured by your absence. If you worry that we will no longer be physically compatible, that somehow we will no longer be able to light the fuse of the atom bomb that is our sexuality, I have to say, you know that not to be true.

While a small sliver of hope will always remain inside of me, Smoove has come to the hard understanding that you are not coming back to me. It is like a part of Smoove has died and, for this part, he has begun to grieve. I am not certain of which stage of the mourning process it is that one begins making lists, but Smoove has begun making them. I now present to you Smoove's Happiest Memories Of When We Were Together:

#5: That time I broke you off nasty outside of that club.

#4: Making love until the dawn on Christmas morning.

#3: The night you invited your friend Cherise into our bedroom and I then hand-fed both of you the succulent berries before getting freaky with both of you in my whirlpool.

#2: The many nights you rode my pony until I couldn't take it anymore.

#1: Waking up before you, and just holding you in my arms until you woke up and then hitting you doggy-style until you lost your mind.

That is only one list of many. I have many complex emotions to work though. And while my hair remains impeccable and my clothes are fresh, the feelings that lie beneath Smoove's surface roil like a volcano waiting for you to calm the tempest by saying those three little words; "I need you." If you were to add the words "now" or "right here on the floor" I would have no problem with that.

Even if you are not interested in once again contacting Smoove, arranging a time to meet, getting picked up in fine white automobile, dancing all night at a popular nightspot, enjoying a late dinner before being loved so hard and long you will think your heart may explode from pure 100 percent uncut pleasure, I will accept this. It has taken Smoove a long time and many heart-to-heart talks with my main man, Darnell, but I have come to grips with the situation.

What Smoove would like you to understand is this: No matter where you are or who you are with, there is a man who smells of exotic lotions who loves you and wants you to be happy. And if you are ever need another taste, Smoove will always be here, ready to break you off some.

Smoove out."""]),
    ('4.html', ["Comedy Tonight!", """
I'm still not sure what possessed me to walk into Laughingstock's Comedy Club and sign up for their open-mic night. But I guess sometimes the less you think about doing something, the more apt you are to do it. For years I had dreamed about bringing my gift for comedy to the live stage. True, I might be more known for the written word, but I'm always coming up with funny things to say out loud. Yet I was way too shy to actually go through with it. Then one day I happened to be driving by the place. I pulled into the parking lot, walked in, and the rest is history. I don't know, maybe it was the big, inviting W.C. Fields stenciled on the front window, or the $8.99 all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp special, which you've got to admit is pretty cheap. Whichever, there was something right about it all.

Of course, try telling all that to Hubby Rick! Boy, I guess he must have permanently lent his sympathetic ear to his barfly buddies at Tacky's Tavern, because when it came to my decision he acted like he was stone deaf! You know what the first thing he asked me was? "Are you getting paid?" Sheesh, with him it's always about the do-re-mi! When I told him no, he scoffed. "I don't get out of bed for less than $9.50 an hour," Rick said. Then he said that hookers have more sense than I do, because they know not to give it away for free. Doesn't he know anything about the world of comedy? It's based entirely on love and truth. The money is secondary. (But like all good clowns, I decided to convert my hubby's grouchy ways into fodder for my act, as you shall see!)

As it turned out, open-mic night didn't take up the whole night; it actually was used as a warm-up thing for the two professional cutups who were performing. I spotted one of them at the bar eating popcorn shrimp—he looked just like the photo tacked up in the glass signboard out front, only a little older, and his hair was less gray. I don't remember his name (he was kind of tall and burly and wore a leather jacket—does that ring a bell for anyone?), but I was eager to say a few kind, encouraging words to the merry jester. I placed my hand on his. He looked a little surprised. I looked straight into his eyes and told him, "Thank you for being a clown. Thank you for making the world laugh and forget its troubles for a minute or two. You provide an invaluable service." Then I walked away. I felt any other words would kill the moment. I had shared something real. I'm sure he very much appreciated it, for as I understand it, clowns live for the attention.

I introduced myself to the club's MC, who took me to a little room where two other amateurs sat. One looked like he was no older than 13, and the other looked to be a college kid. I didn't really talk to them, though, because this was about the time I started to feel really, really nervous and sick to my stomach. Fortunately, I didn't have to go on straightaway, since the college kid went first. I started to gather my wits. That was a good thing, because I almost forgot to put on my funny costume I planned just for this event—a red clown nose, huge polka-dot necktie, and propeller beanie! I thought it was a funny little touch that heightened the spirit of fun.

Soon it was my turn. To hear my name called and the smattering of applause it received was both exhilarating and terrifying! I climbed onstage and was immediately hit with a blinding light pointing at the stage. How do the jokesters put up with that? I could hardly see the notes I wrote on my hand! It so unnerved me that for a few seconds I couldn't say anything into the mic. The silence roared in my ears.

After my eyes got a little more used to the light, I launched into an observational-humor joke. I talked about bottled water, and how it seemed weird to pay for something free. I thought it was pretty funny, but no one really laughed at it. Maybe it went over their heads a little. The younger people probably don't remember a time in which we only drank tap water.

Then I did my couch potatoes joke: "If two couch potatoes mate, does that make their offspring hash browns?" That didn't get too many laughs either. I don't get why not—that joke could be printed in a joke book; it's that solid. Undeterred, however, I launched into that hilarious evergreen, my Pet Rock joke. "I had to put my Pet Rock to sleep recently," I said. "I felt sad, but old Sedi—that's short for sedimentary—had a good run. It lived to 32!"

You could have heard a pin drop. Again, perhaps the reference was too old. So I decided to haul out the big guns and talk about Hubby Rick, because who can't relate to a louse of a spouse who can be a real pain in the patoot? "My hubby drinks so much that the state granted him his own liquor license!" I said. "When we first got married, he promised me a house, and he came through—we're now the proud owners of a Barbie Dream House. 'But you didn't specify the size!' he said."

"Show us your tits," a voice from the audience said.

A couple others immediately screamed "Noooo!" I raised my hands to silence them all. "I don't expect everyone to appreciate clean humor," I said. "Thanks for your time. Enjoy the rest of the show. Good night."

I left the stage. The MC looked a little startled—I guess he expected my act to last much longer. But I tell you, because I refused to stoop to demeaning behavior, I walked off that stage with my head held high (though it made my red nose fall off and I had to pick it up in front of everyone). I returned to the little room to pack my gear, and watched the third act, the 13-year-old, on the closed-circuit TV. He got some big laughs talking about school cafeteria food and mean gym teachers, even though in my view he wasn't any funnier than me. But no matter—my dream of being a clown had come true, and completely on my own terms!

But seriously, I think that Pet Rock joke was a pretty good one. I mean, rocks obviously don't die! Who saw that one coming? """]),
    ('5.html', ["When Are They Going To Finish The Arthur Trilogy?", """
Where were you in July 17, 1981?

Like most Americans, I was standing in line for the premiere of the most awaited film event of the century: Arthur. Dudley Moore had just wowed the critics for his turn in the hit 10, and there was much speculation that this would be an even bigger hit. What an understatement!

Nobody, not even the studio that released Arthur, could've imagined the impact it would have on the world. It was just a simple love story about a drunk millionaire who falls for a poor girl and must choose between following his fortune or his heart. But, oh, the power of that story! Dudley Moore, Liza Minnelli and Sir John Gielgud became household names. Christopher Cross' theme song went platinum. And, of course, millions of people imitated Arthur every day by getting blitzed.

And where was I during all this hubbub? Why, waiting in line to see Arthur again, of course! I saw Arthur a grand total of 218 times in the theater and 735 times on video, and I read the novelization 416 times before the cover fell off and the binding turned to dust. I went to the Arthur conventions, dressed like Arthur for Halloween, and wrote a manual that includes schematics of all the rooms in Arthur's mansion (Attention publishers: The book still hasn't been optioned. Hint! Hint!) I even started my own fan club, King Arthur's Court. Our peak membership was seven Arthurians, but three of them have since died of liver cancer.

Yes, I'm quite proud to say that Arthur has been the guiding force in my life. Though I'm not much of a drinker, I gleaned as much from the film as possible and applied it to my daily life. I hired an acid-tongued butler named Hobson. I started shoplifting like Liza Minnelli's character, Linda. I even wore a top hat in the bathtub!

>Imagine my joy in 1988 when the long-awaited sequel, Arthur 2: On the Rocks, finally arrived. At long last, I could see more adventures of my favorite characters. There they were, Arthur and Linda, on screen together again, and they were married! Imagine my surprise when I learned they were trying to adopt a child, even though Arthur had lost his fortune. Even Hobson, who died in the original movie, came back as a ghost. I was in heaven! I saw Arthur 2: On the Rocks about 150 times, then I bought the video and watched it until it burned up in my VCR and, ultimately, reduced my apartment to cinders.

So now it's been more than eight years since Arthur 2, and I haven't heard boo about Arthur 3. Let's get cracking, Hollywood--the teeming masses are waiting!

The other Arthurians and I have done a lot of research, and we've uncovered some incredible facts. Did you know that Steve Gordon, the writer and director of the original Arthur, wrote three complete Arthur trilogies before he died? The one in which Arthur takes place is actually the second of the trilogies. The first covers the story of how Arthur's father acquired his fortune, and details his battles with opium addiction. In the third trilogy, Arthur's son returns to his grandfather's native country to become a fig farmer, only to come face to face with a rival Hobson's great-grandson! Word also has it that the only characters who will appear in all three trilogies are the Droids.

Much ink has been spilled about next year's theatrical re-release of Arthur. Apparently, Warner Brothers has uncovered some lost footage, and is re-incorporating it into the movie. The missing scenes include one in which Arthur drunkenly falls into a swimming pool at a fancy dinner party.

Warner Brothers also plans to replace all the old special effects with fancy new digital effects, claiming that Arthur will seem even more drunk than before. Well, I say, why fix what ain't broken?! Give us what we really want: the final installment of the trilogy! My fellow Arthurians and I may be a small group, but we're very vocal. We've petitioned Bud Yorkin, the director of Arthur 2, to break the silence on Arthur 3, but he won't return our calls. We've camped out in front of Dudley Moore's mansion and sung Arthur's Theme in all-night vigils, only to be manhandled by Dudley's thuggish security personnel. Even Liza Minnelli, who could use the kind of career boost Arthur 3 would give her, has refused to meet us at the front desk at the detox clinic.

But, by God, we won't give up! We've just got to know what happens next! Will Arthur be able to stay on the wagon long enough to see his son grow to be a man? Will Linda ever return to the stage to reprise her role in Cabaret? And will Arthur and Linda be able to get Hobson out of the carbon freeze? Dammit, Warner Brothers, we demand to know!

Next thang I knew, my Letta Opener headin' straight foe his forehead. Next thang I knew afta that, tha L.O.'s bouncin' off a phone book that Irving thrust in fronta his face, an' fallin' 2 tha flo'. Irving picked it up an' peeped it, then flashed this crazy-ass smile, his grill fulla white veneers. "That, Dog, is for opening letters," he say. He bend tha L.O. in two, an' place it in my deks drawer. Then he smile an' fold his hands ovah his chest, waitin' foe my next move. An' suddenly I freeze. 'Cuz I wuz lookin' into a mirror o' my ol' self.

"This ain't ovah, fucka," I say.

"No, it's not," he say.

Aahhhh-aahhh-aahhhhhhhhh.

Know what? Fuck Irving Weinbaum. Fuck tha A.P., an' fuck tha system that keep an A.R. bruthah down. Fuck a bitch ex who won't let her babydaddy see his shortie no moe 'cuz he supposedly "a bad influence," when she out chickenheadin' tha whole damn A.P. an' I.T. put togetha. Fuck that flute bullshit, an' fuck them Starbux-havin', no-balancin', disrespectin' Midstate punk-ass muhfukkaz. If tha world gonna dis me foe keepin' it real an' kickin' it ol' school, then fuck tha world. I can't do no else. Honor above all, CPA-ONE used 2 say. Homie would undahstand, if no one else here do.

And I'd like to change my life, and you know I would / Just to be with you tonight, baby, if I could / But I've got my job to do, and I do it well, / So I guess that's how it is.

(horn solo)

Daddy H still in full effect, y'all. Tha bling, tha fame, an' tha bitchez keep flowin' in, but that shit ain't what matta. They ain't what kept me in tha game foe so long when so many o' my A.R. bruthahs never got promoted, or got hooked on Sharpies, or gave up on tha reeceevin' an' went into tax preparin' or auditin' or some other pitiful shit.

No, it wuz always 'bout tha numbahs. Tha numbahs. An' this Stone-Col' Funkee-Fresh Mack Daddy Supastar Enforca O' Midstate Office Supply will be crunchin' 'em an' balancin' 'em 2 tha grave. Much luv 2 ya, mah G's. H-Dog OUT. Peace."""]),
