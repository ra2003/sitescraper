    ANALYSIS: The big question before yesterday's eagerly awaited vice-presidential debate between Sarah Palin and Joe Biden was which Sarah Palin would show up.

    The populist, conservative-delighting flame-thrower from the Republican convention four weeks ago? Or the mumbling, incoherent, clearly-out-of-her-depth ingenue from recent television interviews?

    Thanks to those disastrous TV outings, expectations for her performance before the debate were so low that she could have exceeded them simply by coming on stage and smiling beatifically for an hour and a half.

    But she did much better than that, once again confounding her condescending critics with a pleasing fluency and an engaging folksiness, and, for the moment at least, putting a crucial floor under the McCain campaign's freefall of the past two weeks.

    It was, in fact, an impressive debate. Expectations for Senator Biden had not been all that high either, given his long-established tendency towards prolixity and logorrhea.

    But he delivered a highly effective performance. He was coherent and impassioned and mercifully concise, a 36-year veteran of the US Senate clearly in command of his political brief.

    He also skilfully avoided the pitfall of appearing unchivalrous by going after his opponent. He scored points instead by sticking resolutely to repeated, fierce attacks on her running mate (and his Senate colleague and friend), John McCain.

    On the substance, you might choose to award the debate -- just -- to Senator Biden. He seemed more in command of the issues and answered the questions from Gwen Ifill, the moderator, more directly, while Ms Palin -- poised and fluent as she was -- gave the impression at times she was cleaving closely to campaign talking points.

    But impressions may matter more to voters than evidence of detailed knowledge of Washington policy-making.

    The Alaska Governor set the tone for the evening by greeting Senator Biden on stage at the start with a disarming question, clearly audible through her lapel microphone, "May I call you Joe?"

    She punctuated most of her answers with the sort of colloquialisms rarely heard in the liberal metropolitan citadels of New York, Washington and Los Angeles.

    "Doggone it", "You betcha!", she said for emphasis at times. She talked at one point about the values of "Main Street, Wasilla", the town where she was mayor until a few years ago. She sang the praises of elementary school pupils and made a virtue repeatedly of not knowing much about the ways of Washington.

    The folksiness helped reinforce the message of the Washington outsider and the McCain campaign's theme of reform of a corrupt and out-of-touch Government. Neither she nor Senator Biden had much new to say on the financial crisis engulfing the US but her insistence that, at root, the problem was not just about Wall Street corruption but about a failure of personal responsibility among all Americans probably resonated with voters.

    Ms Palin seemed more shaky than Senator Biden on foreign policy, as you might expect. She misidentified General David McKiernan, the NATO commander in Afghanistan, calling him General McLellan, and seemed to misunderstand a question about possible US use of nuclear weapons.

    Senator Biden's most effective moment was probably when he challenged Ms Palin's claim that Senator McCain was a maverick, who had been out of step with President George W. Bush. The Democratic candidate reeled off a long list of foreign policy issues -- from Iraq to Iran and Israel -- where Senator McCain had dutifully supported Mr Bush.

    How much the vice-presidential debate matters is highly questionable. Perhaps the single most famous moment in any such debate was when Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 1988, eviscerated Dan Quayle, his Republican opponent, by deriding his claim to the John F.Kennedy mantle. A month or so later, Senator Bentsen and his running mate, Michael Dukakis, went on to lose that election in a landslide to George Bush Sr.

    But in this election, at a critical moment when the tide has clearly turned against Senator McCain, a dreadful performance by Ms Palin, reminiscent of her recent TV appearances, might have come close to burying the Republicans.

    Instead, she seemed sure-footed and likeable, erasing many of the doubts that surrounded her and breathing at least a little hope into a fairly demoralised Republican camp.

    Last week, Senator McCain probably lost his first debate against Senator Obama by not winning it.

    Yesterday, Ms Palin won her debate by not losing it.

    PROSECUTORS in Queensland are working almost three times as hard as their interstate colleagues on cases, provided with only a third of the funds of the national average.

    And the body set up to defend criminals is paid three times as much as the office trying to put them away.

    An internal review of Queensland's Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has found it is so under-funded, under-resourced and inexperienced that senior staff fear miscarriages of justice could occur.

    State Liberal leader Mark McArdle yesterday released a confidential review of the office of the DPP that was endorsed by its outgoing head, Leanne Clare, who has been appointed a judge of the District Court.

    The office of the DPP has in recent years been criticised for its conduct in the cases of policeman Chris Hurley, who was acquitted of the manslaughter of Mulrunji Doomadgee on Palm Island, and of former chief magistrate Di Fingleton, One Nation founder Pauline Hanson and Olympic swimming coach Scott Volkers.

    The review, ordered earlier this year by Attorney-General Kerry Shine, recommends that 49 prosecutors be immediately appointed and an additional $5.9 million be provided for each of the next three years to overcome the backlog of cases.

    It says the office cannot attract prosecutors because the pay is so low and the workload so heavy.

    The failure to keep senior prosecutors has left young lawyers without mentors.

    Inexperienced legal officers are being appointed to positions because nobody else is applying - with the result that the most competent job is not being done in some cases.

    "The directorate is concerned that the recent premature appointments of inexperienced lawyers is eroding the professional base of the practice and heightening the risk for miscarriage of justice issues," the report says.

    "It is compromising the practice's ability to deliver the best possible prosecution service to the community of Queensland."

    The report cites the case of "an experienced and skilled prosecutor" from the Sydney office of the commonwealth DPP who took a drop in pay to work on the Sunshine Coast, but was head-hunted back to the commonwealth DPP on twice the salary he was being paid in Queensland.

    "The Queensland ODPP has only 67 prosecutors," it says. "On average a Queensland prosecutor must deal with 79 matters each per year as opposed to the national average of only 27.

    "The Queensland ODPP receives funding that equates to approximately $5500 per matter, compared with a national average of $16,000.

    "This high level of workload prohibits prosecutors and legal officers from dedicating adequate time to the preparation of matters that can lead to rushed and ill-prepared decision-making."

    The report points out that additional judges have been appointed in recent years, but no extra funds have been provided by the Government to the ODPP to cope with the added workload.

    The current funding model for the ODPP "gives the impression that funding for criminal matters favours the accused rather than the victim or the community as a whole", it says. "It is interesting to note the funding allocation for Legal Aid Queensland from commonwealth and state sources is $101.3 million."

    This compares with about $30 million for the ODPP.

    The LNG industry should be heard on emissions trading

    UNDER the stewardship of self-declared economic conservative Kevin Rudd and his Treasurer, Wayne Swan, it is unlikely Labor will be fooled for long by the self-defeating logic being applied to the export gas industry by the climate change diehards in Penny Wong's department. The view that putting jobs first or caring about GDP is old-fashioned thinking in a climate-aware world is a surefire route to the political scrapheap. But this is exactly the sort of logic that has forced the liquefied natural gas industry to ask why it should invest $60 billion in new projects that would have provided clean energy to Asia.

    Without Australian gas, China, Indonesia and India will burn their own high-sulphur and high-polluting coal reserves to generate electricity to meet the demands of their rapacious economies. That will mean global carbon emissions will rise and Australian export earnings will fall if we fail to protect the trade-exposed LNG industry - surely an undesirable outcome on both counts. But that is the kind of absurdity that will occur by sticking to a domestic carbon emission target that is not linked into a global scheme.

    By any measure, LNG clearly falls into the category of a trade-exposed industry that qualifies for the special treatment recommended in the Rudd Government's green paper and the Howard government's Shergold report. Under the Shergold plan, however, all trade-exposed high-emission industries qualified for free emission permits to protect Australian jobs and to stop them moving to countries where carbon emissions are less rigidly policed. To allow trade-exposed industries to grow on an un-level playing field, the Shergold plan recommends issuing extra permits to cover increased production.

    The Government's green paper, on the other hand, rations free permits by calculating the ratio between carbon output and turnover. High carbon emitters will be given permits for 90per cent of output, but the number of free permits would be fixed and would be reduced over time. There is no allowance for industry growth.

    Since the Government is determined to set a unilateral target for greenhouse gas reduction, come what may, it will be difficult to issue new permits to assist industry expansion without increasing the burden on other projects that are caught in the emissions trading net. The gas industry and the trade union movement have been quick to grasp the likely impact of Labor's scheme. The nation's biggest blue-collar union, the Australian Workers Union, has called on the Government to adopt the Shergold model.

    The LNG industry's difficulties with the Government's proposed climate change model are symptomatic of a much deeper problem. As Access Economics co-founder Geoff Carmody told The Australian's Paul Kelly last week, by trying to be a good global citizen, Australia loses competitiveness against countries that are free-riding on our efforts. "These countries gain from being slow to act (or not acting at all) as production shifts to them, their imports decline and their exports increase," he says.

    Carmody, who says he has never in his life felt so concerned about a single policy issue, advocates a simple alternative. By setting a target for consumption of greenhouse gases, rather than their production, the export sector, whose output is consumed abroad, will be excluded. There will be no need for free permits or government-controlled exemptions which, like any other stopgap interventionist measure, will certainly prove to be flawed.

    Plainly the debate over the economics of climate change has some way to run. The green paper is far from the last word on the subject. Good policy will not be measured by how good it makes us feel. It will be measured by its global environmental impact and by its price.

    KEVIN Rudd has phoned Afghan President Hamad Karzai to express his concern at a firefight last week involving Australian troops that resulted in the death of an Afghan governor.

    A spokesman for the Prime Minister said Mr Rudd called Mr Karzai on Saturday night, Australian time, to discuss the incident, which occurred near Australia's operating base in Tarin Kowt.

    It is understood Mr Rudd told Mr Karzai the Australian military would work with local authorities to determine the circumstances surrounding the exchange of fire, which left a number of civilians dead.

    "President Karzai expressed his appreciation for the Prime Minister's call and the commitment to co-operate with the Afghan Government's investigations," the spokesman said.

    "He reiterated his earlier public comments that the incident seems to have resulted from a misunderstanding between international forces and local personnel."

    A patrol from Australia's Special Operations Task Group was fired on last Thursday after it approached a house in Oruzgan province, which was believed to be holding Taliban militants.

    Defence said a number of Afghan civilians appeared to have been killed or wounded in the ensuing exchange, including Chora District governor Rozi Khan.

    No Australian troops were injured and Defence said a preliminary review of the incident suggested the Diggers had acted in accordance with their rules of engagement.

    THE great New York Yankees slugger Joe DiMaggio was pricklier than usual in 1968 when Simon and Garfunkel sang: "Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio, a nation turns its lonely eyes to you".

    The way 'Joltin Joe' saw it, he was alive and kicking and hadn't gone anywhere, so it was a dumb question with his name in it and how could they get away with that stuff?

    DiMaggio, the wayward son of a poor Sicilian fisherman, didn't understand that songwriter Paul Simon, a Yankees fan since childhood, was reflecting on lost American innocence and doing him a great honour.

    Sporting heroes are often like that: all grace and power and majesty on the field; shallow and underwhelming off it. Baseball's best are no different.

    If he were alive and somebody rewrote the lyrics of Mrs Robinson to "Where have you gone Yankee Stadium", DiMaggio would probably stare blankly and say "over the road".

    In the literal sense he would be right. At a cost of $US1.6billion ($1.9billion) a shiny new Yankee Stadium is going up across the street from the old one.

    The fabled "House that Ruth Built" will this morning (AEST) play host to its final game when the Yankees host the Baltimore Orioles.

    While this year's painfully disappointing Yankees still have a faint hope of reaching the playoffs, a feat that would give the old stadium an encore, not even the Latinos from the tough, working-class streets that surround the stadium are counting on it.

    So Yankee Stadium, the field of dreams in the South Bronx that gave the US heroes like The Babe, DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson, a place former mayor Rudy Giuliani says is "like going to Gettysburg" so sacred is its aura, has finally reached the end of its journey.

    For New Yorkers, this has been like a death in the family and for the last week the city has been engulfed by Yankee Stadium nostalgia.

    Everyone has had a tale to tell about a great game, a great performance or a time they got to rub shoulders with one of the Yankees legends.

    In The New York Times, Ari Fleischer, the former White House spokesman, wrote of his joy, at age seven, of being told to "shut up" by Mantle during Yankees batting practice in 1962.

    The actor-director Billy Crystal revealed that he had gone to the stadium to pray when his mother had a stroke, sitting in the same seats where he and his father and brothers had watched games when he was growing up.

    When his mother died and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner had the stadium's legendary announcer Bob Sheppard recite her name on Old Timers' Day as a departed member of the Yankee family, Crystal said it "sounded as if God himself announced her name in heaven".

    With trademark hubris, Henry Kissinger declared watching baseball at Yankee Stadium an important stage in his personal discovery of America.

    As a young immigrant in 1938, Kissinger attended games with his Italian co-workers from a shaving brush factory.

    A seat in the centre-field bleachers then cost just 55 cents and afforded a close-up view of DiMaggio prowling the outfield.

    As he moved up in the world, Kissinger graduated from the bleachers to the grandstand to the reserved seats until, finally, in the 1970s, he would sit with DiMaggio and watch games from the comfort of Steinbrenner's private box behind home plate.

    It was times like these, Kissinger said, that he understood "America's ability to make the impossible come true".

    Whether egalitarianism is going to flourish at the new stadium is another question. For starters there will be 5000 fewer seats, which will only increase demand and push up prices.

    The signs are there already. Seats behind the dugouts that cost $US250 not so long ago will cost $US850 when the new stadium opens next year. Anyone wanting to sit near home plate will be looking at a minimum cost per game of $US2500.

    But the real money at the new stadium will come from the luxury corporate suites, private restaurants, banquet halls and expanded retail spaces that are the financial rationale for the construction.

    Take, for example, those centre-field seats where the young Kissinger and his Italian buddies used to hang out for 55 cents a game. In the new stadium that area will be a glassed-in restaurant.

    Times do change. In 1922-23, when Yankee Stadium was built, nobody had ever heard of a corporate suite. When the stadium was substantially renovated in the 1970s, corporate facilities were included, but by today's standards they are totally inadequate.

    In the modern world of sports, where a key measure of financial success is the comfort level of the rich and famous, it was a situation that could not survive.

    The result of this transformation is that going to Yankee Stadium will no longer have that wonderful artisan feel, the kind that used to raise the spirits of Australian Football fans in the old days of the VFL when clubs played their home games in the suburbs.

    At least that is the fear. The scandalous part is that Steinbrenner, one of the 400 richest men on earth, has managed to extract all kinds of tax breaks and concessions from the city of New York to get his new stadium built on the cheap.

    But if ordinary fans are getting screwed every which way, they at least have their memories and the knowledge they were part of something truly grand.

    It was like that from the day the stadium opened with its world-first triple-decker grandstand. The day was April 18, 1923 and the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox 4-1 with Ruth belting a three-run homer, the stadium's first.

    A journalist covering the game called the stadium "The House that Ruth Built". It stuck and Ruth spent the rest of his career trying to live up to the billing, most of the time succeeding.

    During the Great Depression, when he signed a new contract that paid him more than President Herbert Hoover, Ruth was asked if that was appropriate.

    "Why not?" Ruth replied indignantly. "I had a better year than he did."

    Today, the top-paid player in baseball is another Yankee, Alex Rodriguez, who gets $US28million a season. The vast majority of players make at least a million a year. George W Bush makes $US400,000.

    In those early days, Ruth was helped by a stadium design that featured a short right-field boundary. This fabled "short porch" to right as it became known favoured left-handed hitters and over his long career Ruth made full use of it.

    With Ruth leading the way, the Yankees began to build the record that is today the envy of baseball. The club has 26 World Series pennants and clinched nine of them at Yankee Stadium, including Game Six of the 1977 series when Jackson hit three consecutive home runs, each from the first pitch he faced.

    Of course, not all the memories are pleasant. In that same 1977 season, race riots erupted in the Bronx and fires were lit in buildings close to the stadium. It prompted sportscaster Howard Cosell to make the immortal mid-game observation: "There it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is burning."

    Nor are all of Yankee Stadium's highlights been baseball related. In 1965, the stadium was the venue for the first open air papal mass celebrated in the western hemisphere.

    In 1990, Nelson Mandela appeared at a freedom rally here and the bands that have played the stadium include U2 and Pink Floyd.

    In boxing there have been great contests, the most important being Joe Louis's first-round knockout of Max Schmeling in 1938, a fight that Adolf Hitler had hoped to use as racial propaganda.

    The stadium also saw Muhammad Ali defeat Ken Norton on points, and contests featuring legends such as Gene Tunney, Jack Dempsey and Rocky Graziano.

    And on July 1, 1939, there was a notable first when Max Baer beat Lou Nova in the first televised fight.

    There are many other names, too, like soccer star Pele and the legendary football coaches Knute Rockne and Vince Lombardi, who inspired great teams here.

    And there was Don Bradman, who watched a baseball game at the stadium with Babe Ruth in 1933.

    History like that will be a hard act for the new stadium to follow, but next year, in a new home, the Yankees could sure help things along by earning their huge salaries and making the playoffs.

    A LEARNED colleague of mine, a fellow academic, recently explained to me the crisis of languages at our universities. My colleague is brilliant in his field and so I listened intently. His explanation went like this: we are living through a time in which English has established itself as the world language. Most of the important scholarship is done in English; English is also the dominant language on the internet. Foreigners obviously have to learn English to access this scholarship, whereas English speakers do not.

    The decline of enrolments at university can be traced back to schools, where more and more pupils are pulling out of language study. Of course in doing this they are only reflecting the broader social trends already mentioned. My friend then came to speak about the general funding problem in universities. Given this trend away from language learning, he said, it is no wonder that language departments are under threat.

    While the trend is regrettable, there is not much we can do about it. We just have to get better at what we already do, and in languages that means teaching better and doing more research and then hoping for a turn-around in attitudes in society at large; a return of the interest in foreign tongues that we once took for granted.

    I respect my colleague. I have learned many things from him. I call him a friend. But as an explanation of the present situation at our universities, his view about the so-called crisis of languages could not be further from the mark.

    It ranks with the recent statement of a New Zealand minister who maintained that there are one billion Arabic speakers "if you include sub-Saharan Africa". In fact, the total number of Arabaic speakers is estimated at 200-300 million speakers. No doubt there are a few stray Arabic speakers below the Sahara but no country there has Arabic as a national language. It is difficult to know why the minister was so wildly mistaken but even among the highly educated there can be an astonishing lack of knowledge about foreign languages and peoples.

    But back to my friend. He is right, there is a crisis affecting languages at our universities, but it has nothing to do with student interest or the number of university enrolments, enrolments in languages, which are steady or rising in most places. It has nothing to do with any lack of interest in foreign languages in our schools, which has remained robust in recent years, or even with the internet, where the proportion of materials in English on the web continues to decline on a daily basis. The crisis I am speaking about is not even a languages crisis.

    The real explanation -- at least from my vantage point -- goes like this. In 1989 the Australian government introduced student fees, thus rescinding the implicit social contract that had funded all higher education places from 1973 exclusively through taxation.

    The argument used to justify the introduction of student fees was that the beneficiaries of higher education accrue a private benefit and get better-paid jobs than people who do not go to university.

    Like all private benefits, people entering higher education should contribute to the costs of their education according to the principle of "user pays". At about the same time other significant developments occurred.

    The government dramatically increased the number of student places at our universities, and amalgamations between universities abolished the distinction -- the so-called binary divide -- between universities and other tertiary institutions. Then came the most significant development of all: the Howard government stopped indexing funding for universities, effectively freezing funding at 1996 levels.

    Universities since this time have had to meet the greater portion of their costs from their own earnings: by the early 2000s the government was providing significantly less than 50 per cent of the running costs of most universities in Australian higher education.

    The funding regime has therefore undergone a revolution, and universities have been hard hit. From a position where universities never had to imagine running their operations as a fully-fledged and autonomous business, they are now called upon to do so. Apart from a few success stories, most universities have had mixed results attempting to raise their own revenues and thus to close the gap between what the government pays, what the student contributes and what universities really need in annual funding in order to remain viable.

    There has been considerable overreach as universities have become more deeply involved in the highly volatile international student market. Foreign campuses have been opened, mostly with disastrous results. The experiment of a private university, loosely attached to the public arm of the main university, which was attempted at the University of Melbourne, did not reap the expected benefits.

    Despite the attempt to conceive of higher education as a private good, the truth is that higher education is still predominantly a public good that lives off the accumulated good will, effort and reputation of generations of teachers and lecturers and the positive experience of students who have successfully passed through the system. To suggest that these things can be costed and the future good -- the degree or diploma -- adequately recompensed at the door upon accessing the system, much as you would pay for a new car from a car dealer, does not ring true.

    We have told ourselves that higher education can operate this way, but few of us in the system really believe it. Our daily experience teaches us otherwise. Nevertheless, we must now face the consequences of viewing higher education in this way. A direct consequence is that economies of scale must be sought where they can be found, which means bulging class sizes and lectures filled to capacity where students are most numerous: in their first years of university. Unlike the idealism of the past, when core curriculum studies were introduced on the basis of a view about what was considered important to know, the current interest in foundation or core curriculum studies is driven by the financial imperative.

    Universities are nevertheless aware that their reputation will still be earned through research, and research-led teaching, rather than from providing students with a generalist education. Thus a peculiarly modern tension has arisen between mass provision of generalist courses at lower levels and specialist courses with a research component at the upper levels of the curriculum. This tension is beginning to play out in predictable ways at some of our institutions with the appearance of "teaching only" positions and the emergence of higher tier appointments designed to shore up the research effort.

    Another effect of this two-tiered system is that more and more postgraduate students will be absorbed into the teaching effort as a cheap way of resourcing the generalist arm of the curriculum, with serious consequences for higher degree completions times and rates, to say nothing of the consequences for the general quality of student learning.

    But I still haven't answered my friend. Or have I? The simple truth is that successful language learning is conducted in small seminar and tutorial groups, not in large lecture theatres, so no real economies of scale actually occur. Only a small proportion of language specialists will graduate to master's and doctoral study, and these will be among the more costly graduates we produce in the modern university.

    While there is an undoubted intellectual benefit to be gained in the whole system from maintaining specialists who read, speak and teach languages other than English, who focus their research mostly on non-local concerns, who interact with the international language community in their home locations and, through their teaching, contribute immensely to the unending labour of overcoming the provincialism of our communities and sometimes also our community leaders, the existing economic model does not admit this sort of benefit, and indeed it is probably unable to do so.

    We are left, like Don Quixote de la Mancha, the ingenious hidalgo, to tilt forever at the windmills of the collective unconscious, hoping that the public good will become obvious to all, though we can never scientifically prove it, or never prove it according to the conditions of the science we live by.

    My friend, it seems, like the sober Sancho, the patient companion of the endearing and love-struck Quixote, was probably right in some way after all. We are in crisis because we have allowed the economic imperative to govern us. We feel the crisis acutely in languages, because languages is one of the areas of the modern university -- like classical studies, philosophy, and now even English and history -- that is most exposed when the wind of financial stringency blows.

    We now favour the applied, quantifiable research of the laboratory over less concrete projects that contribute vital knowledge about ourselves and our societies, just as we favour overflowing lecture theatres over modest seminar rooms, no matter what we teach in them. We have changed the funding paradigm, and now the paradigm is changing us.

    Yet it need not be so: we still recall the redoubtable Quixote and the consciousness that created this work of genius 400 years ago. Let us not forget how to read it.

    Tim Mehigan is professor of languages and chairman of the department of languages and cultures at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. He used to teach at the University of Melbourne and is a fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities.
