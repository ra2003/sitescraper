    ('1.html', ["US media ownership rules relaxed", """US regulators are to relax local media ownership rules preventing firms from controlling both a TV channel and a newspaper in its largest cities.

    The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to scrap a 32-year old rule preventing dual ownership of print and broadcast outlets in 20 cities.

    In a 3-2 split vote, Republican members said the move "struck a balance" between competition and plurality.

    But dissenting Democrats said it would create new loopholes, not close them.

    The Republican chairman of the FCC, Kevin Martin, cast the deciding vote.

    He called the move a "relatively minimal loosening of the ban", adding it "may help to forestall the erosion in local news coverage".

    Political issue

    The issue is politically contentious, with groups within both houses of Congress pressing the FCC to delay its judgement and threatening to pass legislation to revoke the decision.

    However, the White House has warned it will veto any bill coming out of Congress which waters down the proposed changes.

    The decision overturns rules in place since 1975 designed to support diversity of opinion and competition among news suppliers.

        
        The public has repeatedly told us they are not interested in further media consolidation
        Jonathan Adelstein, Democrat commissioner of the FCC

        Proponents of reform argued that the proliferation of cable TV channels and the growth of the internet meant such safeguards were now obsolete.

        But critics said that while the number of media outlets had exploded, the amount of different news providers had not risen.

        "The law says we are to serve the public interest," said Jonathan Adelstein, one of the two Democrat commissioners on the FCC panel.

        "And the public has repeatedly told us they are not interested in further media consolidation."

        The new rules will apply to the largest 20 local media markets in the country.

        For dual ownership of a newspaper and TV channel to be permitted under the new system, eight independently owned media businesses must exist in the market concerned, while the TV channel cannot be among the four most-watched.

    The Danish firm has, however, rebutted media reports that it had already got as far as final talks with one buyer.

    Lego was responding to speculation that it was about to sell the parks to US private equity firm Blackstone for $460m (£253m).

    Lego instead said it expected to complete a deal by the end of summer.

    The firm is selling the parks after it recently saw its overall losses double.

    Lego has said that the sale would free up cash to support its core toy business.

    Previous takeover

    "The Lego group refutes rumours that a sale of the parks has taken place or that final negotiations with one bidder are underway," it said.

    Lego has four Legoland themeparks: San Diego, California; Windsor in the UK; Guenzburg in Germany; and Billund, Denmark.

    Blackstone, the New York-based company said to be leading the race to buy the parks, has already expressed an interest in buying the Legoland sites.

    It has also only recently taken over the company which owns popular London tourist attraction London Dungeon.

    On Monday, 23 May, Blackstone announced that it had bought Merlin Entertainment for £102.5m. Merlin also owns 19 Sea Life centres across Europe.

    Back in April Lego announced that its annual net losses had more than doubled to 1.9bn Danish kroner ($328m; £174.9m) - only the fourth loss in the family-owned firm's 72-year history.

    In recent years, Lego has unsuccesfully tried to diversify away from its core building bricks.

    It invested heavily in a host of new markets, including computer games, baby products, camping goods and even shoes, few of which have performed to expectations.

        AT Kearney retail consultant, Hana Ben-Shabat, told the BBC that opening under its own brand was a good move for Tesco.

        "They won't think of Tesco as British - but as another Western chain.

        "The Western supermarket chains are starting in the main cities, like Beijing, Shanghai and some others.

        "I think the biggest challenge, in terms of gaining market share, is going to be how quickly all of them can move into the second-and-third-tiered cities."

        Another challenge was understanding local consumers and their tastes, she added.

    ('4.html', ["Waiters lose tips legal challenge", """Restaurants were right to count non-cash tips as part of waiters' wages, human rights judges have ruled.

    Four waiters argued two London restaurants had infringed their human rights by adding tips, left as part of cheque and credit card payments, to their wage packets as "additional pay".


    The only way to be sure the money goes to the waiter is to leave a cash tip

    Solicitor Catherine Scrivens

    But the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has upheld the decision by UK courts to reject the complaints - ending a 10-year legal battle.

    Unions and low pay campaigners have condemned the ruling.

    The Paradiso e Inferno, in The Strand, and the Trota Blu, in Leicester Square, did not infringe the waiters' human rights, the court ruled on Tuesday.

    One of the waiters Julio Rodriguez has died since the legal battle began.

    Damages rejected

    The four waiters - Italian Sandro Nerva and Spaniards Mr Rodriguez, Jose Pulleiro and Jose Gigirey-Cabo, sued for breach of contract over the additional pay being counted towards their wages.


    I believe the court has done an injustice not only to us but to all waiting staff

    Waiter Sandro Nerva

    Their claim for damages in the High Court on the basis they had received less than the minimum wage given to waiters was rejected in 1994.

    Tips paid by cheque or credit card belonged to the employer and could count towards payment of a minimum wage the court then ruled - a decision upheld by the Appeal Court.

    When the waiters were refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords they argued in Strasbourg that their rights to protection of property and against discrimination, under the European Convention on Human Rights, had been breached.

    Tuesday's judgment said the legal title to tips paid by customers using cheques or credit cards passed to the waiters' employers as vouchers were made out to them.

    Waiters received as "additional pay", what they would have received had the tips been paid in cash, minus tax and national insurance contributions.

    It held, by six votes to one, that there had been no breach of their rights to protection of property and unanimously that there had been no violation of their rights not to be discriminated against.

    Tips vital

    The waiters' solicitor Catherine Scrivens said waiters had been given protection under the wages councils for hotel and catering workers because they worked long hours for low pay.

    Waiters often work long hours
    "Customer tips are an important source of income," she said.

    "I am sure most customers believe that when they leave a credit card tip that it goes to the waiter.

    "The only way to be sure the money goes to the waiter is to leave a cash tip".

    She called for legislation compelling restaurants to state on menus whether credit card tips were passed on in full to waiters and waitresses.

    Richard Towers, director of the Low Pay Unit said: "People should have a decent living wage without having to rely on tips."

    A spokeswoman for the GMB union said: "Tips are a reward for good service, not an excuse for employers to renege on their responsibility to pay wages."

    Costly decision

    Waiter Mr Nerva said: "I believe the court has done an injustice not only to us but to all waiting staff," he said.

    The 64-year-old, of Pimilco, London, believed the policy had cost him £20,000 during his time working at the Paradiso e Inferno.

    But the restaurant manager, who declined to give his name, said he had thought the case had finished five years ago.

    "But I'm not surprised at the result, there's nothing wrong with what we are doing

    "In 1979 the Inland Revenue told us, you must start deducting tax and National Insurance on any tip that comes through the house, ie credit cards and cheques - that's what Mr Nerva is unhappy about."

    Strong demand for Nintendo's Wii also helped the total amount spent on consoles, games and accessories reach $1.2bn, research firm NPD said.

    But analysts were surprised to see that every console system bar the Wii saw hardware sales decline from March.

    Analysts said the early Easter could have been partly to blame.

    Temporary blip?

    The Wii sold 714,000 units in April helping to lift hardware sales 26% to $426.2m.

    But Microsoft's Xbox 360 and the Sony PlayStation 3 both saw lower sales in April compared with March.

    NPD analyst Anita Frazier said she was "surprised" at this decline considering that GTA IV is designed for these two consoles.

    Figures from the NPD showed that GTA IV sold nearly 2.9 million copies in the US in its first five days.

    But Ms Frazier observed that since the game was only in the market for five days during the reporting period, the sales lift could take place in May.

    After GTA IV, other top selling games included Nintendo's Mario Kart Wii and Sony's Gran Turismo 5: Prologue.

    These helped software sales jump 68% to $654.7m.

    Train drivers launched a 62-hour strike on Wednesday targeting freight trains and have now begun a 48-hour action affecting passenger services.

    Regional and suburban services have been hit, with severe disruptions in Berlin, Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

    Deutsche Bahn said its 10% pay offer, which unions have rejected, was fair.

    Widespread disruption

    The GDL union is seeking a 31% pay rise for its 34,000 workers, saying they are significantly underpaid compared to their counterparts in other leading European countries.

    Thursday's stoppage - the sixth in the past three months - is the most serious yet in a dispute which German ministers have warned could do serious damage to its economy.

    Deutsche Bahn, which has drafted in temporary workers to keep some services running, has said that each day of strike action would cost it 50m euros ($73m; £36m).

        
        Union leader Manfred Schell
        We want a negotiable offer
        Manfred Schell, GDL union

        Only half of normal regional services were running in the west of the country while in the east, this figure was down as low as 10%.

        Only a third of suburban trains were operating in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, and Stuttgart, while commuters in Berlin faced severe delays as only 20% of trains departed.

        Traffic on city centre roads quickly built up to much-higher than normal levels.

        But mainline inter-city services were less badly affected, with more than 70% of services running normally.

        'No surrender'

        In a series of newspaper advertisements, Deutsche Bahn called on GDL union officials to "stop this madness".

        "If we were to cave in now, the damage to the economy would ultimately be far greater," Deutsche Bahn executive Karl-Friedrich Rausch said.

        "They are trying to force us to an unconditional surrender. That is not going to happen."

        But union officials said management had failed to put forward an improved offer which could persuade them to return to the negotiating table.

        "The Bahn management board must once and for all stop provoking strikes," GDL chairman Manfred Schell said in a statement. "We want a negotiable offer."

        Train drivers are holding out for a much better deal than other Deutsche Bahn employees have received, arguing they merit a separate settlement on pay and working conditions.

        In July, two other rail unions representing 195,000 workers agreed a 4.5% pay deal.
